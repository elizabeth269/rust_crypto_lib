# Rust Crypto Library

This Rust library provides AES-256-GCM encryption and decryption functions using the `ring` crate. The library aims to offer secure cryptographic operations in a simple and efficient manner.

## Features

- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Secure your data using AES-256-GCM encryption.
- **AES-256-GCM Decryption**: Decrypt AES-256-GCM encrypted data.
- **Random Nonce Generation**: Ensure security with random nonce generation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)

### Installing

Add this line to your `Cargo.toml` under `[dependencies]`:

```toml
ring = "0.16.20"
```
